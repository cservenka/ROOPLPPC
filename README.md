# ROOPLPPC

*ROOPLPP* is a compiler translating source code written in **Reversible Object Oriented Programming Language++** (ROOPL++) to the reversible assembly language Pendulum ISA (PISA).

The compiler is to be considered proof-of-concept in connection with my Master's Thesis on the ROOPL++ language.
